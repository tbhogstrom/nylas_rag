Here’s a complete script that outlines how you can use the Nylas API to fetch emails sent by a user, store them in a vector database (Milvus), and then use OpenAI to query that database to generate a response in the tone of the user’s emails.

Steps in the Code:

1.    Nylas API Setup: Fetch emails sent by a specific user.
2.    Milvus Setup: Create a Milvus collection to store email content and their vector embeddings.
3.    Embedding Email Content: Use SentenceTransformer to convert email content into vector embeddings.
4.    Search in Milvus: Query the Milvus vector database to find emails with similar context.
5.    Generate a Response: Use OpenAI’s API to generate a reply based on the context retrieved from the vector database.

This script can help automate the process of generating email responses in a personalized tone, combining the power of Nylas API, Milvus for vector search, and OpenAI for text generation.
